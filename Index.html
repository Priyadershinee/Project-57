        <h3>I love reading very much</h3>
        <p>It is so hard to tell when someone asks about hobbies which we do for our recreation &amp; stress releaf right?? Because there many hobbies that you have but why to choose one of them, Well I will tell why I like reading: When I was 7 years old I actually didn't Like to read much but for past couple of years I think reading is really important because everywhere we read as in we read people's mind, we read books only for understandings. It is a scource of getting information, Knoledge ,Education, Emotions and better thoughts which are reevent and more logical.Reading a book allows us to see the outside world, meaning that by reading many books our views will become wider, making us smarter and wiser in living this life. Reading can make as a good self-entertainer. Every time you feel bored, try to grab a good book and start reading. So It is not hard at all to just read a book page daily or chapters as it makes the feelings rise up and we really get into the book so rather than watching a movie we can grab a book and start reading without any strain in the eyes. Good Luck for Reading!!!ðŸ“™.
